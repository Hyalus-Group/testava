USE OF COOKIES

FA’s website utilizes different technologies to collect, store, and aggregate data about website usage. We may use electronic tags called “cookies” to help us understand and analyze use of our site. This work is either performed directly by us or by a third party we’ve hired to assist us. We collect information about which pages have been accessed and for how long, the country the user accesses the site from, and certain technical information regarding the user’s computer and operating systems, such as user Internet protocol address, domain name and browser, etc.

Certain sections of FA’s site require cookies to be enabled to enhance site performance. For example, cookies provide a secure way for us to verify user identity during a session and any return visits, they enable us to personalize a user’s experience on our sites, and they help enhance site navigation. Cookies also help us to understand how people use our sites so we can improve site functionality.

When a user comes to the website, our server sends a cookie to the user’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not identify the user personally; they merely recognize the user’s browser. Generally, personally identifiable information is obtained by us only when a user decides to provide it, such as when requesting additional information via email or providing personal information.

We use two types of cookies on our sites, temporary cookies and persistent cookies. Temporary cookies are used to store information during a browser session and will expire shortly after concluding a visit to one of our sites. Persistent cookies are used to store information between visits to one of our sites and are stored permanently or for a specified length of time. Persistent cookies are used to facilitate easier navigation within our sites and provide a higher level of convenience for the user.

A user can choose to have their computer issue a warning each time a cookie is being sent, or a user can choose to turn off all cookies. The management of cookies generally is handled through the user’s browser settings (e.g., Chrome). To obtain more information about managing cookies, visit www.aboutcookies.org.
